This repository records my history of practicing by make my own simple iOS apps.
The idea is to make simple small app to practice as much SDK & design patterns as possible.
My goal is to make my own useful (maybe even revolutionary) apps and ship it to the market
So before that I need to construct the idea and practice all the potentional functions HERE with all these small apps

I hope I can keep it on.
